# Decision-tree

## Decision Tree Classification Analysis

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply Decision Tree Classification to a given dataset, analyze the model's performance, and interpret the results to understand the decision-making process of the model.

### Tasks
### 1. Data Preparation
#### Data Loading:
- Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment, such as Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Data Exploration:
- Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's structure and contents.
#### Data Cleaning:
- Check for and address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
#### Data Visualization:
- Visualize the distribution of features using histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand data characteristics and relationships.

### 3. Feature Engineering
#### Preprocessing:
- Perform necessary feature engineering techniques such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and handling any remaining missing values.

### 4. Decision Tree Classification
#### Data Splitting:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using an 80-20 split.
#### Model Implementation:
- Implement a Decision Tree Classification model using a library such as scikit-learn.
#### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
#### Optimization:
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Decision Tree model. Experiment with various hyperparameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples split, and criterion to 
  improve model performance.

### 6. Model Evaluation and Analysis
#### Performance Analysis:
- Analyze the performance of the Decision Tree model using the obtained evaluation metrics.
#### Visualization:
- Visualize the decision tree structure to understand the rules learned by the model and to identify the most important features influencing the decision-making process.
